    private int height;     -----  how tall  
    private String color;   ----- color like red


--- this will be how to make the new rectange vvv

-------- with x hight
    public int calcArea()

------ shows what you want to print
    public String toString()

    }

------------------ RectangleRunner.java ---------------------
public class RectangleRunner

        --------this will make 4 rectanges using the blueprint
        Rectangle rect1 = new Rectangle(5, 8, "yellow");
        Rectangle rect2 = new Rectangle(2, 10, "blue");
        Rectangle rect3 = new Rectangle(10, 3, "violet");
        Rectangle rect4 = new Rectangle(7, 4, "red");

    ----- this will print them to String() and runs automaticly
        System.out.println(rect1);
        System.out.println(rect2);
        System.out.println(rect3);
        System.out.println(rect4);
    }
}

havent done vvv

1. Which class is being used as a blueprint to create
rectangle objects? How do you know?

2. What are the names of the object attributes that 
are outlined in the blueprint class?

3. What value does the `width` attribute have in the
`Rectangle` class on line 4? Why? How does this relate
to the process of creating rectangle objects (lines 
6-8 in `RectangleRunner`)?


4. In summary, what is the difference between a class
and the objects it creates?
